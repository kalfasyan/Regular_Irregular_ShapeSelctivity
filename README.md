# Regular_Irregular_ShapeSelctivity

Github repo for the research paper titled:
"Representations of regular and irregular shapes by deep Convolutional Neural Networks, monkey inferotemporal neurons and human judgments" by Ioannis Kalfas and Rufin Vogels (2017).

## Neural data :
regular_irregular_SPIKES_yannis.mat

## Stimuli :
Inside directories: /regularIrregular/ and /regularIrregularSmall2x/

## Extracted features and models: 
Features of stimuli are to be located inside a /features/ directory of this repository, but they will be provided through a link for download because they take a lot of disk space.
Same goes for the models used (/models/ directory inside repo).

### Terminology :
"untrained" refers to the untrained Alexnet.
"untrainedVGG" refers to the untrained VGG19.
The rest are self-explanatory.

Better documentation to be added..
